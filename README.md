# AutoNet - AI-Powered Network Security Automation Tool

!Project Status
!Python
!React
!Cisco
!Ansible

**AutoNet** is an intelligent network security automation platform that transforms hours of manual configuration work into a one-click AI-driven workflow. Network engineers upload topology descriptions (text/PDF/natural language) and instantly receive validated Cisco IOS configurations, deployment-ready Ansible playbooks, and interactive network visualizations, with built-in security validation.

> **Built for:** Network Engineers | Security Operations | Technical Project Managers | DevOps Teams

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Configuration Generation
Generates **85% accurate** Cisco IOS configurations from natural language descriptions using Google Gemini API. Supports routers, switches, and basic firewall ACLs with CCNA standard validation.

### Security Validation Engine
Automatically checks configurations against CCNA security best practices:
- ACL analysis and policy enforcement
- Authentication protocol validation (AAA, SSH)
- Port security configuration checks
- Weak credential detection
- Optimization recommendations

### Automated Deployment Pipeline
Creates production-ready Ansible playbooks enabling consistent, repeatable deployment across multi-vendor environments (Cisco, HP, Juniper). Reduces deployment time from 2-4 hours to 15-20 minutes per device.

### Interactive Network Visualization
Instantly renders professional SVG topology diagrams from text descriptions. Perfect for stakeholder communication, documentation, and design reviews.
